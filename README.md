## Overview

The HR Analytics project focuses on understanding HR requirements, gathering and transforming data, creating matrices using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), and dashboarding to provide valuable insights into human resources management.

## Project Stages

### 1. Understanding the HR Requirements

In this phase, we aim to gain a deep understanding of HR requirements within the organization. This involves:

- Identifying key HR metrics and KPIs.
- Analyzing the organization's HR processes and workflows.
- Defining the scope of data required for analysis.

### 2. Gathering and Transforming Data

Data is the foundation of HR analytics. In this phase, we:

- Collect relevant HR data from various sources, including employee records, performance evaluations, and recruitment data.
- Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- Transform the data into a format suitable for analysis.

### 3. Creating Matrices Using DAX

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a powerful tool for creating matrices and performing calculations. In this phase, we:

- Utilize DAX functions to calculate key HR metrics and KPIs.
- Create matrices and visualizations to represent HR data effectively.
- Perform advanced calculations to gain insights into employee performance and HR processes.

### 4. Dashboarding

Dashboards are essential for presenting HR insights in a clear and actionable manner. We have designed three unique dashboards to focus on specific data points:

#### Dashboard 1 (Excel)

- Presents overall HR data, including total revenue, transactions, and average transaction price.
- Analyzes HR-related metrics monthly to identify trends.
- Explores HR trends over the years to identify fluctuations.
- Examines top contributors to HR performance.
- Analyzes HR data for specific HR-related categories.
- Evaluates HR methods to determine the most effective strategies.

#### Dashboard 2 (Excel)

- Concentrates on specific HR aspects, analyzing HR categories in detail.
- Groups related HR data and analyzes group performance monthly.
- Studies HR data by total quantity to identify top performers.
- Identifies top contributors to HR success.

## Dashboard 3 (Power BI)

- A comprehensive Power BI dashboard providing in-depth insights into HR performance, HR category analysis, and HR methods evaluation.

## GettingStarted

## Insights

1. **Employee Performance Trends**: Analyze historical employee performance data to identify trends and patterns. Understand which employees consistently perform well and those who might need additional support or development.

2. **Recruitment Effectiveness**: Evaluate the effectiveness of the recruitment process by analyzing the time-to-hire, cost-per-hire, and the quality of hires. Identify areas for improvement in the recruitment strategy.

3. **Employee Satisfaction Analysis**: Measure and track employee satisfaction through surveys or feedback mechanisms. Identify factors that contribute to high satisfaction and those that may lead to employee turnover.

4. **Training and Development Impact**: Assess the impact of training and development programs on employee performance and career progression. Determine which programs are most effective in enhancing skills and knowledge.

5. **Retention Analysis**: Analyze employee turnover rates and identify the reasons behind resignations. Use this information to implement retention strategies and reduce attrition.

6. **Diversity and Inclusion Metrics**: Monitor diversity and inclusion in the workplace by tracking metrics such as gender and ethnicity representation, pay equity, and inclusion survey results. Ensure a diverse and inclusive workforce.

7. **Workforce Planning**: Utilize data to plan for future workforce needs. Identify skills gaps and develop strategies for recruiting or upskilling employees to meet future demands.

# KPIs

1. **Employee Turnover Rate**: Measure the percentage of employees who leave the organization within a specific period. This KPI helps assess employee retention efforts.

2. **Time-to-Fill**: Calculate the average time it takes to fill a job vacancy from the moment it's posted. A shorter time-to-fill indicates efficient recruitment processes.

3. **Cost-per-Hire**: Determine the average cost incurred to hire a new employee, considering expenses like advertising, interviews, and onboarding. Lowering this cost is usually a desirable goal.

4. **Employee Satisfaction Score**: Develop a survey-based KPI to measure employee satisfaction. Regularly gather feedback and track improvements or declines over time.

5. **Training ROI**: Calculate the return on investment for training and development programs. Compare the cost of training to the subsequent increase in employee productivity or other relevant metrics.

6. **Diversity Index**: Create an index that quantifies the diversity of the workforce based on factors like gender, ethnicity, and age. Monitor this index to ensure diversity goals are met.

7. **Skills Gap Index**: Measure the gap between the skills required for key roles and the skills possessed by current employees. This KPI helps prioritize training and hiring needs.

8. **Promotion Rate**: Track the percentage of employees who are promoted internally. A high promotion rate can indicate effective talent development and career advancement opportunities.

9. **Absenteeism Rate**: Calculate the percentage of scheduled work hours that employees miss due to unplanned absences. High absenteeism rates can impact productivity and morale.

10. **Performance Appraisal Completion Rate**: Monitor the percentage of employees who complete performance appraisals on time. Timely appraisals are essential for feedback and development.
